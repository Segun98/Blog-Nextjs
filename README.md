I am not sure how this project would end up like but I hope to use these tools.

- Nextjs
- Typescript(never used it)
- Graphql(never used it)
- Expressjs
- MongoDB

It ended up being an online publishing platform.

Tools used: 

- Nextjs
- Graphql
- Expressjs
- MongoDB

Didn't use Typescript, I ran into some errors, apparently I need more lessons on it.
